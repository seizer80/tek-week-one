    <p> <b> Tempe </b> The Hohokam lived in this area and built canals to support their agriculture. 
        They abandoned their settlements during the 15th century, with a few individuals and families remaining nearby. 
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_McDowell,_Arizona" >Fort McDowell </a> was established approximately 25 mi (40 km)
         northeast of present downtown Tempe on the upper <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_River_(Arizona)" > Salt River</a> in 1865 allowing for 
        new towns to be built farther down the Salt River. US military service members and Hispanic workers were hired to grow food and 
        animal feed to supply the fort, and less than a year later, had set up small camps near the river that were the first permanent communities in 
        the Valley after the fall of the Hohokam. (Phoenix was settled shortly afterward, by 1867â€“68.)
        The two settlements were 'Hayden's Ferry', named after a ferry service operated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_T._Hayden"
          >Charles T. Hayden</a>, and 'San Pablo', and were located west and east of Hayden Butte respectively.
         The ferry became the key river crossing in the area.
         The Tempe Irrigating Canal Company was soon established by William Kirkland and James McKinney to provide water for alfalfa, wheat, barley, oats, and cotton. </p>
